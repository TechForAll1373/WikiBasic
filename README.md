*   **بخش‌های تخصصی** برای امنیت، گیمینگ، تولید محتوا و سخت‌افزارهای قدیمی.
*   **پوشش جامع محیط‌های دسکتاپ (DE) و مدیران پنجره (WM)**.
*   **معرفی پروژه‌های ویژه شما** با بنرهای اختصاصی و هماهنگ.
*   **بخش‌های پیشرفته** مانند مسیر یادگیری لینوکس و ترفندهای خط فرمان.
*   **استفاده از جداول، بخش‌های جمع‌شونده (`<details>`) و بنرهای رنگی** برای حداکثر زیبایی و کارایی.
